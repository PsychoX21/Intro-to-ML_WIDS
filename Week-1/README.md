## Python Setup

-   https://realpython.com/installing-python/ </br> refer to this link for installing python in your system

## VS Code Setup

-   For installing VS Code in your system refer https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview

## Python Resources

-   https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp ; this is a pretty good resource for python
    -   All sub-sections in the Python Tutorial section except inheritance, iterators, Polymorphism, Dates, JSON, and regex; I expect you to go thoroughly through these sections
    -   All sub-sections in File Handling, go through this thoroughly.
    -   Go through string, list, tuple, dictionary, set methods in the Python Reference section; you don't need to remember all these, so make sure to understand what can be done using these; you can always refer here for the exact function
        This is not an exhaustive set of resources, you will definitely need to look over other concepts/resources when solving the assignments

## Python Libraries Resources

Here you only need to remember a few basics in Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas. For most of the syntax and functions, you will need to refer to the documentation or just Google it

-   Numpy - https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_intro.asp; go through the Numpy Tutorial section
-   Pandas - https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_intro.asp; go through all sections to thoroughly understand the use of various functions and techniques for efficient data manipulation.
-   Matplotlib- https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp; go through Python Matplotlib section, here don't spend much time just go through the stuff and make sure you can plot simple line plots, scatterplots, bars, and histograms

## Work Plan

-   You may spend 3-4 days on learning python, 2-3 days on Python Libraries
-   Spend more time on solving the assignments, you will be learning many things while solving only
-   Since this is the first week, I am expecting decent involvement in the project, and hence you may feel this week be slightly hectic but this is completely fine
-   I made the Python assignments tougher than the Libraries assignment, because you will mostly be needing the libraries concepts only in the coming weeks, but learning core python concepts is important
